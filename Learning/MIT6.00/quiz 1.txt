6) It should print: 4, 5, 0, but def addUp will throw an IterationError, because dictionaryies 
are not inherently iterable, other methods, like .keys() or .iteritems() need to be used

No, for two reasons, one is not using d.keys(), and two is that result is not defined at the
print statement at the end, because it local to addUp, and was not assigned to in __main__
